    SpinPossible is a boardgame. That purpose of the game is to return a board back to its starting configuration using a list of predefined "spins". The standard configuration of the board is a 3x3 square with numbering of 1-9 in each cell of the square. The numbers are right-side-up (You can have up-side-down tiles). The board is then scrambled using a list of defined spins. A spin is defined as a rectangle of the board pieces that you can rotate 180 degrees. The goal is to minimize the number of spins you use. There are 36 different valid spins on a 3x3 board. 
    This game deals heavily with Group Theory in Abstract Algebra. A 3x3 board with 180 degree spins allows for a complete group. There are a lot of subgroups in this game. Another cool thing about this is the generators that can create the board. A generator is what we can build every possible board out of with as few spins as possible. The common generator that we use is toggling the first tile, t, spinning the first and second tile, s1, spinning the second and third, s2, spinning the third and sixth tile, s3, spinning the sixth and fifth tile, s4, spinning the fifth and fourth tile, s5, spinning the fourth and seventh tile, s6, spinning the seventh and eighth tile, s7, and finally spinning the eighth and ninth tile, s8. Using these nine moves, we are able to create every single possible board of the 3x3. 
    Starting with any scrambled board, the player's goal is to be able to unscramble the board. Using any valid spin, the player will play spins to slowly unscramble the board.
