   Our goal is to create a version of SpinPossible that allows for easy user interaction. We would like to be able to create different difficulties of boards, as well as different board sizes. This would allow for further working in Group Theory for any Abstract Algebra class. An interactive GUI will be made. Toggling between generators. Ease of use is a primary goal. We would like to put in the GUI that will allow a user to easily select spins. There will be randomly generated boards and a number of max spins. Two different styles of play. A free-reign style allowing the user to mess around with the game is one. A solve game is the other version.
